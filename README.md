# OSCILLUNA: where sound meets the art of starlight ⋆.˚ ☾ .⭒˚

## why i made it
I made this project for Hack Club's Athena Award, specifically so I could practice my JS abilities as well as practice cool features in CSS to style my site!! it's lunar/space themed because i like the moon/stars and also purple.

## what it does
* this site takes musical input in the form of c-major scale notes. these notes become oscillating lines across the canvas, that can be customized further by user input of three different colors that create a gradient on the waves (which also changes the header gradient) or by altering the volume/amplitude of the waves. 
* the user can record their art by pressing the "start recording" button, which will save a file of their created waves with a transparent background.


## how i made it
* i created this site with the help of hack club's oscillart tutorial. it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
* i made it on an old chromebook with github codespaces (vscode) using chrome os to view my site. so, i'm not sure how well it will appear on other devices. just know that it's intended for the web at 100% view.

* the favicon/moon logo on the site were created in pixel art by me! i used pixquare on my phone but i would NOT recommend this as apparently that app only lets you make two total art files for free?? 
* to those who do pixel art i would suggest resprite on ios or aesprite online instead - learn from my mistake of deleting my moon drawing file to make room for more, only to realize i should've made it transparent and that i can't recover that file.....


## struggles & learning 
* I don't have much prior practice with advanced web formatting, so in the CSS I had to look up a lot of resources. (shout out to w3schools and the left sidebar grid layout by matthew james taylor....i love you guys)

* the javascript was also a bit complicated. as i don't have much experience, i would often follow the code from the hack club tutorial, and when it wasn't specific enough on where to put certain lines, i would manage to mess it up somehow and spend around another hour sifting through my code to figure out where i messed up!! but, eventually, i would always manage to debug my code...a true lesson in perserverance or something like that!! 

* at one point i even realized that i was looking at my live preview site at 80% percent zoom so I had to spend a while fixing everything so it would look that way at 100% zoom instead....it look me so much longer to code this than i expected but it was a good experience nonetheless

* anyways despite the hurdles i think i understand a lot more about CSS/JS/HTML now, like how to customize a volume bar or how to make gradient text!!
