# OSCILLUNA: Where music and art shine.

## why i made it
I made this project for Hack Club's Athena Award, specifically so I could practice my JS abilities as well as practice cool features in CSS to style my site!! 


## what it does


## how i made it
i created this site with the help of hack club's oscillart tutorial. it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. i made it on my old chromebook on github codespaces using chrome os to view my site. so, i'm not sure how well it will appear on other devices. just know that it's intended for the web at 100% view.

# struggles & learning 
I don't have much prior practice with advanced web formatting, so in the CSS I had to look up a lot of resources. (shout out to w3schools and the left sidebar grid layout by matthew james taylor....i love you guys)

the javascript was also a bit complicated. as i don't have much experience, i would often follow the code from the hack club tutorial, and when it wasn't specific enough on where to put certain lines, i would manage to mess it up somehow and spend around another hour sifting through my code to figure out where i messed up!! but, eventually, i would always manage to debug my code...a true lesson in perserverance or something like that!!
